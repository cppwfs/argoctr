= CTR Argo Demo

A basic boot application that generates and launches the Argo yaml for a composed task DSL.   The DSL is based on the one used by Spring Cloud Data Flow.

Code is still in exploration phase (and thus really dirty).
Currently supports the following structures:

* Conditional Executions
* Transitions

== Building

```
./mvnw clean package
```

== Executing
Currently the application just for exercising the various aspects of Argo.
Uncomment the line you wish to execute from the `quickDSLDemo` method in the `ArgoctrApplication` class.

```
java -jar target/argoctr-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
