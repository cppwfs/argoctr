= CTR Argo Demo

A basic boot application that generates the Argo yam for a CTR and then launches the associated yaml.

Code is still in exploration phase (and thus really dirty).
And with that it currently only supports:

* Conditional Executions
* Transitions

== Building

```
./mvnw clean package
```

== Executing

This is currently run as a series of hard coded composed tasks, just for exercising the various aspects of Argo.
Uncomment the line you wish to execute from the `quickDSLDemo` method in the `ArgoctrApplication`.

```
java -jar target/argoctr-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
